##Talk Abstract

##Who's your ideal audience?
Folks from non-traditional backgrounds for whom the "typical" advice (get a CS degree, attend a bootcamp) just won't work.

##Why are you excited to talk about this at Open Source & Feelings?
After years of piecing together a coding education for myself with online resources and struggling to find ways to attend meetups and conferences, I've finally found myself with that mythical foot in the door. (I'm not actively trying to wedge it open the rest of the way.) I've hit a lot of obstacles (both external and internal) and want to share my ideas, mistakes and hope with my fellow wannabes. :)

##Speaker Accomodations
Speakers will receive a complimentary ticket to Open Source & Feelings. As speakers ourselves, we understand the expense that speakers often incur. Unfortunately, we have limited ability to provide travel or hotel accommodations. Please, don't let that stop you from proposing a session. It is important that we be able to know all the great content we might miss so that we can highlight this fact to the sponsor and attendee communities.

If your proposal is selected and travel expenses would prevent you from attending, we would like to work with you to help you attend the conference. Answering this optional question will help us get a better sense of the impact travel and housing costs have on speakers, and will not be used in our selection process.

##Will travel and lodging make attending Open Source & Feelings financially difficult?

##Making Life Easier
If your proposal is selected, there are a few pieces of information we need to properly celebrate/publicise your talk. These items are optional, but they really do make our lives easier. :)
