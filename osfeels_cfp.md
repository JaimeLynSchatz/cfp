##Talk Title
*Build Your Own Door to a Career in Tech*

##How long is your presentation (in minutes; 10-40 is average)?
10-15 minutes (need to actually time it)

##Talk Abstract
You know who you are. Liana Leahy's "Let Me Code" is your theme song. You follow your favorite rock star developers on Twitter. You've got all the badges on Codecademy and FreeCodeCamp and you're first online for CodeSchool's free weekends. You stay up late at night and get up early in the morning to fit in just One. More. Commit. The word is out that you don't really need a CS degree to get started in tech, but that doesn't help you know how to start on the "alternative" path.

The first half of this talk will outline my own journey through the Struggle, Succeed, Repeat cycle as I've built my own door to a career in tech. In the second half, we'll talk about how you can take the parts that worked and build your own door to a career in tech.

##Who's your ideal audience?
Folks from non-traditional backgrounds for whom the "typical" advice (get a CS degree, attend a bootcamp) just won't work.

##Why are you excited to talk about this at Open Source & Feelings?
After years of piecing together a coding education for myself with online resources and struggling to find ways to attend meetups and conferences, I've finally found myself with that mythical foot in the door. (And I'm actively trying to wedge it open the rest of the way!) I've hit a lot of obstacles (both external and internal) and want to share my ideas, mistakes and hope with my fellow wannabes. :)

##Balancing Information
This information is not given to the selection committee until a late round in the selection process. It is used to provide contextual information about proposals and provides additional differentiation between similarly strong proposals.

##Previous Speaking Experience
In 2015, I was lucky enough to have been selected to speak at RailsConf about inclusive tech education and how folks without CS degrees have so much to offer the industry.
In 2014, I ran a(n abbreviated) worshop on Open Source tools for the uninitiated for SeaGL, a local Gnu/Linux conference here in Seattle.

##Have you presented on this topic at other events? If so, where and when?
I've never presented on this topic before.

##Tell us about your experience with open source.
I would decribe it as unrequited love. I completed a brief internship with Wikimaps Historical Streetmap project where I learned just how complicated brownfield projects can be! :) I rely heavily on various open source projects (Rails, especially) and one day want to be good enough to give back (beyond the bits of documentation and test writing I've done for other projects.) I consider myself very much a newbie when it comes to contributing to OS.

##Tell us about your involvement with your communities.
I'm a host once a month at the local GDI Study Group. I've also recently begun assisting with Code Dojo on the Eastside, leading kids learning to code. I volunteered as a TA once at Railsbridge (and can't wait to do it again! The Railsbridge energy is INCREDIBLE!) I've done bits of other volunteering, too (Seattle Code Camp and with my First Lego League robotics.)

##Speaker Accomodations
Speakers will receive a complimentary ticket to Open Source & Feelings. As speakers ourselves, we understand the expense that speakers often incur. Unfortunately, we have limited ability to provide travel or hotel accommodations. Please, don't let that stop you from proposing a session. It is important that we be able to know all the great content we might miss so that we can highlight this fact to the sponsor and attendee communities.

If your proposal is selected and travel expenses would prevent you from attending, we would like to work with you to help you attend the conference. Answering this optional question will help us get a better sense of the impact travel and housing costs have on speakers, and will not be used in our selection process.

##Will travel and lodging make attending Open Source & Feelings financially difficult?
No, not at all. I live in the Greater Seattle area.
